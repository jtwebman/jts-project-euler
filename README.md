# JT's Project Euler Answers in JavaScript

Project Euler is a site to learn new ways of solving common problems and
practicing with new questions every week. I learned programming on my own
when I was a kid so learning data structures and how to solve problems in
different ways has been a huge help.

If you are hiring take a look ;)

If you are a programmer don't use these to cheat but let me know if you know
of a fast better way to solve them.
